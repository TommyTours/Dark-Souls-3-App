# Dark-Souls-3-App

## About
This app was designed and built for the Mobile App Design unit during my Computer Science degree course at the University of the West of England.
The unit was primarily front end design and development based and as such I did not prioritise back-end concepts such as data storage and persistence.

## Purpose
This is an iOS app used for planning character builds on the video game "Dark Souls 3".
The app is split into three main views, navigated between using tabs these are:
### Character
This is the main function of the app, the user creates a new character, assigns stat points and then chooses the equipment they wish to use.  Once they have done this the app will calculate whether the character meets the requirements for the chosen equipment, and if not will calculate how many levels they must gain to buy the required stat points.
### Weapons
This view allows the user to view details about the various weapons in the game
### Armour
This view allows the user to view details about the various armour pieces in the game.

## Notes
The appp was esigned for and tested on iPhone 11 in Dark Mode.
Currently only portrait orientation supported.
